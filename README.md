# VendingMachineSales

This project analyzes sales data from a vending machine to identify trends, popular products, and opportunities for improvement. The data includes information on the date and time of each transaction, the product category, the product name, and the transaction amount.

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have Python 3 installed, along with the following libraries:
  -pandas
  -matplotlib
You can install these libraries using pip, like this:
pip install pandas matplotlib
This will run the script and generate the visualizations.

## Usage
To use this project, you'll need to download the Vending Machine Sales Data file in CSV format. Then, you can run the vending_machine_sales.py script to analyze the data and generate visualizations.

The script uses the pandas library to read the data file into a DataFrame, clean the data, and perform various analyses. It also uses the matplotlib library to create visualizations of the data.

The script includes several functions that perform different analyses and generate different visualizations. To run the script, simply open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the script is located, and type:

## Results
The analysis of the vending machine sales data revealed several interesting insights:

-The most popular product category is Food, followed by carbonated and non-carbonated drinks
- The best-selling product overall is the KitKat Bar, followed by the Monster Energy Drink.
- There is a positive correlation between transaction amount and time of day, with the highest sales occurring in the afternoon and evening during the month of July. The least transactions occurred during the Winter months in the afternoon despite typical foot traffic from holiday shoppers.
- These insights can be used to optimize the product offerings, pricing, and promotion strategies for the vending machine. This could be removing certain products that are not selling well or adding more of the popular products to prevent selling out.
- The highest selling vending machine locations were located within the mall, while the least selling was in the library
